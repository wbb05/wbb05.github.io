Hello, I am William Bowles, a Junior at Virginia Tech, currently pursuing a Bachelors in Computer Engineering with an intended focus in Controls, Robotics, and Autonomy. I am a transfer student from Virginia Western Community College, where I got my Associates in Engineering. Some of my hobbies include reading, especially sci-fi and fantasy. You can find my email and other contact info on this site.
